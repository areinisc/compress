Compress
Nick Walker and Alex Reinisch
30 March 2012

Summary:
	This program takes images in the form of a bitmap (represented by one and zeros) and compresses them according to a recursive function that tries to fill in the dominant colors according to a given color threshold percentage

Partnership:
	Alex and I worked out the best way to complete the assignment by reading through the assignment explanation together.  Then, Alex coded the program on his computer while I watched and continued to look out for any potential bugs or problems with our methods. We worked through the debugging process together.

Comments:
	Segfault issues
	Segfaults solved by resizing vectors
	Output works, no working function
	Input works, no recursion
	More cases needed
	Segfaults caused by inputs that need to be changed
	Example outputs working

    * repo up, putting things together
    * working up skeleton code
    * fixed segfault issue by resizing vector image before filling it
    * correct output order, no recursive function yet
    * correctly takes in vector of strings
    * working on recursion
    * need to put in the other four cases for method lossy
    * ok, test case where nothing changes works, but re-writes cause seg-faults... looking into it
